# Notebooks for Triage and Incident Response: A Tale of DBA Heroismâ€‹

In this session you will learn how to leverage Azure Data Studio and notebooks to monitor and diagnose SQL Server and Azure SQL instances. Cornerstone tools such as extended events, PowerShell, and dynamic management views (used by DBAs and Azure CSS alike) can be combined with the power of Azure Data Studio and T-SQL notebooks to facilitate managing your data estate. Modernize your troubleshooting / incident response guides to executable and automatable guides, for efficient root cause analysis, mitigation and auditing!
